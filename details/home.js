What makes a machine intelligent? AI is an interdisciplinary science with multiple approaches, but advancements in machine learning and deep learning are creating a paradigm shift in virtually every sector of the tech industry. ",
            para2:"However, decades before this definition, the birth of the artificial intelligence conversation was denoted by Alan Turing's seminal work, Computing Machinery and Intelligence (PDF, 89.8 KB)(link resides outside of IBM), which was published in 1950. In this paper, Turing, often referred to as the father of computer science, asks the following question, Can machines think?  From there, he offers a test, now famously known as the Turing Test, where a human interrogator would try to distinguish between a computer and human text response. While this test has undergone much scrutiny since its publish, it remains an important part of the history of AI as well as an ongoing concept within philosophy as it utilizes ideas around linguistics."
